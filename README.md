# CAD-for-detection-and-diagnosis-of-colonrectal-cancer
The project's goal was to develop a CAD (Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis) system to improve patient management with colorectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapies. The main challenge was to predict the tumor's response to pre-surgical radio-chemotherapy, aiming to reduce unnecessary therapies and proceed directly to surgical intervention when appropriate.

Within the project, advanced feature extraction and image processing techniques were employed. Subsequently, through the use of machine learning classifiers, the aim was to characterize the suspicious tumor area and predict the patient's response to therapy. This process helps to identify cases where neoadjuvant therapy is more likely to be effective, thereby minimizing the patient's exposure to superfluous treatments and their side effects.

The proposed CAD relies on fully automatic tumor segmentations, ensuring a reduction in workload for physicians. The system's accuracy was a critical consideration, especially during the construction and training phases, given the possibility of discrepancies between automatic and manual segmentations.
